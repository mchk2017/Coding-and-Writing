## INTRODUCE THE JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ##

**What is a computer?**<br>
A computer is composed of *hardware* and *software*. The hardware is some physical and 
tangible pieces that support computing power. The software consists of programs and the 
data those programs use. A *program* is a series of instructions that the hardware executes
one after the other. Programs are sometimes called *applications*.

**What is a programming language?**<br>
A programming language specifies the words and symbols that we can use to write a program.
A programming language employs a set of rules that dictate how the words and symbols can be
put together to form valid *program statements*. 

**The Java programming language**<br>
The Java programming language was created by Sun Microsystems, Inc. It was introduced in 1995 
and its popularity grew quickly.

A Java program is made up of one or more *classes*. Each class contains one or more *methods*.
A method contains program *statements*.

A Java application always contains a method called `main`.

Shown below is the basic structure a Java program:

```java
//********************************************************************
// Lincoln.java Java Foundations
//
// Demonstrates the basic structure of a Java application.
//********************************************************************
public class Lincoln {
	//-----------------------------------------------------------------
	// Prints a presidential quote.
	//-----------------------------------------------------------------
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("A quote by Abraham Lincoln:");
		System.out.println("Whatever you are, be a good one.");
	}
}
```
A typical Java program like `Lincoln.java` above has a class and a method(the `main` method). 
Each class has a *class header* and a *class body*. By the same token, each method
consists of a *method header* and a *method body*. 

You can add *comments* almost anywhere in the program. Comments should be added to explain 
the purpose of the program and describe processing detail. They do not affect how a program
works. Java comments come in three forms:

```java
// this comment runs to the end of the line
/* this comment runs to the terminating
   symbol, even across line breaks */
/** this is a javadoc comment */
```

**Identifiers**<br>

* The words a programmer uses in a program are called _identifiers_
* An identifier can be made up of letters, digits, the underscore character (\_)
and the dollar sign
* An identifier cannot begin with a digit
* Java is _case sensitive_. So `Total`, `total` and `TOTAL` are three different identifiers
* By convention, programmers take advantage of different case styles for different types of
identifiers, e.g. 
  * _title case_ for class names - `Lincoln`
  * _upper case_ for constants - `MAXIMUM`
* Sometimes we choose identifiers ourselves when writing a program (such as
`Lincoln`). Sometimes when we use another programmer's code, we need to use
the identifiers that he or she chose (such as `println`). Often we use special
identifiers called _reserved words_ that already have a predefined meaning in
the programming language. A reserved word cannot be used in any other way.

**Java reserved words:**

 A - C       | D - F       | G - N       | P -  S      | T - W 
-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------
abstract     | default     | goto*       | package     | this
assert       | do          | if          | private     | throw 
boolean      | double      | implements  | protected   | throws
break        | else        | import      | public      | transient 
byte         | enum        | instanceof  | return      | true 
case         | extends     | int         | short       | try
catch        | false       | interface   | static      | void 
char         | final       | long        | strictfp    | volatile 
class        | finally     | native      | super       | while
const*       | float       | new         | switch      | 
continue     | for         | null        | synchronized|

**White space**<br>

* Spaces, blank lines, and tabs are called _white space_
* White space is used to separate words and symbols in a program
* Extra white space is ignored

**Program formatting**<br>
A valid Java program can be formatted many ways. At any rate, programs should
be formatted to enhance readability (e.g. using consistent indentation).

## PROGRAM COMPILATION AND EXECUTION ##

** Basic programming steps **<br>
A program is written in an editor, compiled into an executable form, and then executed.
If errors occur during compilation, an executable form is not created.

**What is the mechanics of developing a program?**<br>
This involves several activities:

  * writing the program in a specific programming language (such as Java)
  * translating the program into a form executable by the computer
  * investigating and fixing various types of errors that can occur

Software tools can be used to help with all parts of this process.

**Language levels**<br>
There are four programming language levels:

* machine language (e.g. for x86 processors)
* assembly language (e.g. for x86 processors)
* high-level language (e.g. Java)
* fourth-generation language (e.g. SQL)

Each type of CPU has its own specific *machine language*. The other levels were created to make it easier for a human being
to read and write programs

**Compilation and Java's approach**<br>
A compiler is a software tool which translates *source code* into a specific target
language. Often, that target language is the machine language for a particular CPU 
type. However, Java compiler is somewhat different.

The Java compiler translates Java source code into *bytecode*. Java bytecode is not the
machine language for any traditional CPU. Another software tool, called *interpreter*,
translates bytecode into machine language and executes it. Therefore the Java compiler is
not tied to any particular machine/CPU. Java is considered to be *architecture-neutral*.

**Environments for program development**<br>
A *development environment* is the set of tools used to create, test, and modify a 
program. And an *integrated development environment* (IDE) combine these tools into
one software program. All Java IDEs contain key tools such as a compiler and interpreter.
Some include additional tools such as a *debugger*, which helps a programmer to find 
errors.

There are many IDEs that support the development of Java software, including:

* Eclipse
* NetBeans
* BlueJ
* jGRASP
  
Though the details of these IDEs differ, the basic compilation and execution process is
essentially the same.

**Syntax and semantics of a program**<br>
The *syntax* defines how identifiers, reserved words, and symbols can be 
put together to make a valid program. The *semantics* of a program statement defines 
what that statement means (i.e. its purpose or role in a program). A program that is
syntactically correct is not necessarily semantically/logically correct. A program will
always do what we tell it to do, not what we <u>meant</u> to tell it to do.

**Errors that can occur in a program**<br>
There are three types of errors:

* _compile-time errors_ - The compiler will find syntax errors and other basic problems
* _run-time errors_ - During program execution, a problem such as trying to divide by zero
will cause a program to terminate abnormally
* _logical errors_ - A program may run, but produce incorrect results as a result of, 
perhaps, an incorrect formula.

## PROBLEM SOLVING IN GENERAL ##

**Problem solving process**<br>
The purpose of writing a program is to solve a problem.
 
Solving a problem consists of several activities:

- understand the problem
- design a solution
- consider alternatives and refine the solution
- implement the solution
- test the solution

These activities are not linear â€“ they may overlap and interact.

**How to design a solution**<br>
The key to designing a solution is breaking it down into manageable pieces. Such separate
pieces are responsible for certain parts of the solution. An *object-oriented approach*
is suitable for this kind of solution decomposition. Under this approach, our solutions are
dissected into pieces called _objects_ and _classes_.

## THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS ##

**Basic development activities**<br>
Any proper software development effort consists of four basic *development activities*:

- establishing the requirements for solving a problem
- creating a design
- implement the design
- testing the implementation

These steps are not linear and may often overlap and interact

* _Sofware requirements_ specify what a program must accomplish
* _Functional specification_ documents the expression of these requirements
* A _software design_ indicates how a program will accomplish its requirements
* _Implementation_ is the process of writing the source code that will solve the problem
* _Testing_ is the act of ensuring that a program will work as intended given all the
constraints under which it must perform 

## OVERVIEW OF OBJECT-ORIENTED PRINCIPLES ##

**Object-oriented programming**<br>
Java is an *object-oriented* programming language. An object is a fundamental entity
in a Java program. Objects can be used effectively to represent real-world entities.
For instance, an object might represent a particular employee in a company. Each
employee object handles the processing and data management related to theat employee.

**Objects**<br>
An __object__ has _state_ (descriptive characteristics) and _behaviours_ (what it can do).
For instance, the state of a bank account includes its account number and its current
balance; the behaviours associated with a bank account include the ability to make
deposits and withdrawals. Note that the behaviour of an object might change its state.

**Classes**<br>
An object is defined by a __class__, i.e. a class is the blueprint of an object. The class
uses methods to define the behaviours of the object. The class that contains the main
method of a Java program represents the entire program. 

**Classes and objects**<br>
A class represents a concept, and an object represents the embodiment of that concept.
Multiple objects can be created from the same class.

A class is like a blueprint of, say, a house from which you can create many of the "same"
house with different characteristics.

One class can be used to derive another class via/from inheritance, such that classes
can be organized into hierachies.

An object is _encapsulated_, protecting the data it manages.
