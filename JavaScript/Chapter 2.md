## Doing arithmetic
## Assigning values
## Comparing values
## Assessing logic
## Examining conditions
## Setting precedence
## Summary<br>
   * Arithmatic operators are + add, - subtract, * multiple, / divide, % modulus, ++ increment, and
     -- decrement
   * When the ++ increment or -- decrement operator prefixes the operand its value is changed immediately,
     but when they appear after the operand the expression is evaluated first
   * The basic = assignment operator should not be confused with the === equality operator, which compares
     two operands
   * Combined assignment operators +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=, each perform an arithmetic operation then assign
     its result
   * The += operator is useful to append to an existing string
   * Two operands can be compared for === equality, !== inequality, > greater-than value, or < less-than value
   * The <= and >= combined comparison operators also return true when both operands are equal
   * The logical && AND operator evaluates two operands and returns true when both operands are true, but
     the logical || OR operator return true when either operand is true
   * The logical ! NOT operator can prefix a single operand to return its inverse value
   * Conditional operator ?: evaluates a condition for a true or false value then executes one of two 
     specified statements according to the result
   * Expressions being evaluated for a true or false value need not include === true as that assessment
     is made automatically
   * Operator precedence can be set by enclosing an expression within parentheses to override the default
     operator priority
   * Where a statement contains nested expressions within parentheses the innermost expression gets evaluated 
     first
