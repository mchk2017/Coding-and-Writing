# Coding-and-Writing

This is a self-learning site aimed at programming, both front-ended and back-ended. 

Front-end languages includes HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript together with some popular libraries like jQuery; 
and back-end ones, C, Python, Java, Haskell, etc.

Each one is based on a specific book of introductory level.

Hope I can keep on and finish this project in less than one year!
