# Coding-and-Writing

This is a self-learning site aimed at programming, both front-ended and back-ended. 

Front-end languages includes [HTML5](https://github.com/mchk2017/Coding-and-Writing/HTML5/ "THE BOOK ON HTML5.md"), [CSS3](https://github.com/mchk2017/Coding-and-Writing/CSS3/ "THE BOOK ON CSS3.md"), 
and [JavaScript](https://github.com/mchk2017/Coding-and-Writing/JavaScript/ "THE BOOK ON JAVASCRIPT.md") together with some popular libraries like 
[jQuery](https://github.com/mchk2017/Coding-and-Writing/jQuery/ "THE BOOK ON JQUERY.md"); 
and back-end ones, [C](https://github.com/mchk2017/Coding-and-Writing/C/ "THE BOOK ON C.md"), [Python](https://github.com/mchk2017/Coding-and-Writing/Python/ "THE BOOK ON PYTHON.md"), 
[Java](https://github.com/mchk2017/Coding-and-Writing/Java/ "THE BOOK ON JAVA.md"), [Haskell](https://github.com/mchk2017/Coding-and-Writing/Haskell/ "THE BOOK ON HASKELL.md"), etc.

Each one is based on a specific book of introductory level.

Hope I can keep on and finish this project in less than one year!
