# Coding-and-Writing

This is a self-learning site aimed at programming, both front-ended and back-ended. 

Front-end languages includes [HTML5](http://./HTML5/THE BOOK ON HTML5.md), [CSS3](http://./CSS3/THE BOOK ON CSS3.md), 
and [JavaScript](http://./JavaScript/THE BOOK ON JAVASCRIPT.md) together with some popular libraries like 
[jQuery](http://./jQuery/THE BOOK ON JQUERY.md); 
and back-end ones, [C](http://./C/THE BOOK ON C.md), [Python](http://./Python/THE BOOK ON PYTHON.md), 
[Java](http://./Java/THE BOOK ON JAVA.md), [Haskell](http://./Haskell/THE BOOK ON HASKELL.md), etc.

Each one is based on a specific book of introductory level.

Hope I can keep on and finish this project in less than one year!
