# Coding-and-Writing

This is a self-learning site aimed at programming, both front-ended and back-ended. 

Front-end languages includes [HTML5](/HTML5/THE BOOK ON HTML5), [CSS3](/CSS3/THE BOOK ON CSS3.md), 
and [JavaScript](/JavaScript/THE BOOK ON JAVASCRIPT.md) together with some popular libraries like 
[jQuery](/jQuery/THE BOOK ON JQUERY.md); 
and back-end ones, [C](/C/THE BOOK ON C.md), [Python](/Python/THE BOOK ON PYTHON.md), 
[Java](/Java/THE BOOK ON JAVA.md), [Haskell](/Haskell/THE BOOK ON HASKELL.md), etc.

Each one is based on a specific book of introductory level.

Hope I can keep on and finish this project in less than one year!
