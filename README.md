# Coding-and-Writing

This is a self-learning site aimed at programming, both front-ended and back-ended. 

Front-end languages includes [HTML5](/HTML5/THE%20BOOK%20ON%20HTML5.md), [CSS3](/CSS3/THE%20BOOK%20ON%20CSS3.md), 
and [JavaScript](/JavaScript/THE%20BOOK%20ON%20JAVASCRIPT.md) together with some popular libraries like 
[jQuery](/jQuery/THE%20BOOK%20ON%20JQUERY.md); 
and back-end ones, [C](/C/THE%20BOOK%20ON%20C.md), [Python](/Python/THE%20BOOK%20ON%20PYTHON.md), 
[Java](/Java/THE%20BOOK%20ON%20JAVA.md), [Haskell](/Haskell/THE%20BOOK%20ON%20HASKELL.md), etc.

Each one is based on a specific book of introductory level.

Hope I can keep on and finish this project in less than one year!
